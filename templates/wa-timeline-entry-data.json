The dragon they find before them is not a chromatic or metallic, but instead a amethyst gem dragon known as Pymbosedeonth, the Voiceless. He treats with the party, exhibiting a strange magical prowess unfamiliar to the party. He offers the party what they desire (yes, the artifact) if they in turn perform a favor for him. <span class=\"line-spacer d-block\"> </span>  He tasks the party to infiltrate a aggressively expanding domain of duergar known as the Spikeiron Duergar. They have a forge that is producing powerful weapons and armor that is emboldening the Spikeiron Duergar to get ever closer to Pymbosdeonth's domain. Pymbosedeonth wants the secrets of their forge uncovered and dismantled. <span class=\"line-spacer d-block\"> </span>  Before the party leaves, the ancient gem dragon has a telepathic communication with the guardian of the forest thereafter she declares she will be staying with the dragon while the party moves on. The last the party sees of her before they exit Pymbosedonth's lair is her doffing her armor in front of the dragon. </p>"

    "htmlDescription": "<p class=\"m-b-0\">Quickly, the tunnels the party is traveling down give way to carved out mining tunnels of the Spikeiron Deurgar. The Dragon Knights find the mining tunnels quickly give way to a natural cavern system the Spikeirons use as a main thoroughfare. The Spikeirons, true to their name, spike the corpses of their slain enemies on jagged curved metal pylons as warnings to those that might invade their domain. <span class=\"line-spacer d-block\"> </span>  As the party travels closer to the Duergar's domain, the temperature of the natural cave system begins to rise. Soon, the party finds themselves drenched in sweat. <span class=\"line-spacer d-block\"> </span>  Hearing voices approach, Adam conjures a bat familiar to scout out what is ahead of the party. He sees a warband of Spikeiron Duergar, using Steeder spiders as pack mules, marching through the tunnels towards the party. Standing their ground, the party attacks and destroys the warband but not without a cost. Raz, Argos' Brass Dragon Wymling companion, is slain in the battle. </p>"

Through the Duergar's eyes, Adam sees a semi-circular room with a large forge centered on the back wall illuminated by twin lava flows on both sides of the room. Halfway submerged in the lava flow on the left side of the room is a caged and restrained Balor demon. Working at the forge is a older female dwarf, streaks of grey peppered through her knotted, dirty, and singed blond hair. </p>"

To aid in the infiltration, the party makes both members invisible and summon eight pixies to help. <span class=\"line-spacer d-block\"> </span>  As the hit-squad makes their way into the Zarintirth Stronghold, they're surprised by warhorns sounding throughout the cavern and many of the visible duergar rushing towards the top of the stronghold. Utilizing this distraction, Adam and Shuyun make their way to the lower entrances after being briefly caught by a wandering patrol. <span class=\"line-spacer d-block\"> </span>  The two of them duck inside and after eliminating a couple guards, they make their way down to the forge. The Balor sees through their invisibility and beseeches them to free him and in return he will grant them anything they desire. Before they're able to interact with the dwarf at the forge, they hear the shouts of guards coming down to the forge. Adam places the immovable rod in front of the door and activates it, buying them enough time to talk to the dwarf. She tells them she's not leaving until she finishes her masterpiece, the Balor attacks Shuyun for not trying to free him, and the Spikeiron Duergar arrive, commanded by a half-mechanical duergar. <span class=\"line-spacer d-block\"> </span>  A fight ensues and the two party members barely escape with their lives. They head back, defeated, to the rest of the party. As they do, they witness factions of deurgar forming and fighting other duergar on all levels of the keep. </p>"
